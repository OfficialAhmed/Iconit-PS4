This application is much convenient than uploading the icons manually, it automates the following:

* Backup original icons
* Upload and overwrite icons to the `PS4`  
* Game ID `CUSA` to game title conversion
* Image conversion `JPG, ICO ...` to `PNG`
* Image to textures conversion `PNG` to `DDS`
* Resize images to the required size `512x512`, `1920x1080`
